#+TITLE: MacOS Notes

This repository is a compilation of the things I've noticed and learned while
using MacOS for software development.

** M1 Macs and Node.js
As of the time of writing this (<2021-07-11 Sun>), Node.js versions under 15 do
NOT support the M1 ARM architecture. You can, however, install those versions
with Node.js on an M1 Mac by using the Rosetta 2 translation layer when doing
the install so that those Node.js versions get compiled under the =x86_64=
architecture.
